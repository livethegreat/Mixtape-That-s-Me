                Big dreams that we have l wonder if<br> 
                We gonna make it, stand a chance to sit at the<br>
                table with Jay Z, cheeks are sore from smiling, red carpet<br>
                We posing, but what if we make it, and end up losing you<br>
                I'm afraid, I'm sure you heard that money raised<br> 
                People it's a root, though we dwell in heaven so did<br>
                The devil yet we depend on this root to make a living,<br>
                Raise children, l guess it's fate that we evil.<br>
                What if l fail to make us stand and pose on the red carpet?<br>
                I hate pity, how would l noticed that l failed<br>
                if l kept trying? I know sometimes it doesn't work<br>
                but l keep praying, praying to God for better cards<br> 
                Though l get tired<br>
                <br>
                
                [Verse 2]<br>
                
                There are many people, working so hard as much as l do<br>
                Not any of them has written a song about you<br>
                I'm not pounding my chest coz they got their own lovers too<br>
                So why should l listen to fools, with prejudice views?<br>
                Advising me to do, what other rappers are doing<br>
                Can't they see that we different and our stories are different?<br>
                Anyway that's the pain of not being at the top<br>
                What would really hurt, is you not knowing who l am<br>
                So what if this game, requires me to compromise<br>
                Who l really am? but a starving man is willing<br>
                To lose all his cool, even if this game is dishing<br>
                Spoiled and salty food, but l think I'm fortunate<br> 
                Because l never crave, especially for a free lunch<br> 
                It carries obligations, and so for us we reap the fruit we sow<br>
                It's difficult, to trust yourself when everybody has <br>
                A second thought, l like to pretend like "who cares?"<br>
                Though l get tired<br>
                <br>
                
                
                
                [Verse 3]<br>
                This was meant to be a love song, but in the abattoir<br> 
                It's difficult to think 'bout poems, you'd be stunned<br> 
                By what people can do when seeking gold, and appluads<br>
                I should tell you how you make me feel, coz you don't know<br>
                I should tell you that l love you still, you know those words<br>
                They are ringing a bell inside you, people use them<br>
                In movies and movies ain't real, these are words<br> 
                That were said by the cutest couple, that everybody<br> 
                Loved a couple that never made it, these are words<br>
                That were said by your own enemies, enemies<br> 
                That bought you flowers and made you happy these are words<br> 
                that l used when my actions were saying otherwise<br>
                In your past you met people, some you left<br>
                But l always remained in your heart, this is love<br>
                But despite the pain this word can cause, Thank you God<br>
                Coz some people never felt this way, i feel it everyday<br> 
                but I never get tired
