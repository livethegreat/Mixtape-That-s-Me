                Cruel and brutal life we chained to, the living<br> 
            Are in pieces, others picked to cease to exist, for the silence<br> 
            Live brush your teeth and wash your face my darling<br> 
            I'm telling you everything, l cannot always be there<br> 
            Flush your phone in the toilet to keep our ears at ease<br>
            Jeez jus leave and pack your things l would be pleased<br>
            I noticed, you not flourishing at school<br> 
            But promise one thing that you'll propel your limit until you achieve<br> 
            Your mission, for peace sake, your father<br>
            Wants you to visit him, but that is pissing you off<br>
            With him you bound to turn wine to water to get along<br> 
            Still in teenage to make decisions<br> 
            Hence l would be at fault, it would seem like it's me<br>
            Turning you against him, you my son and my angel<br>
            I'd never lead you to hell, in my absence have faith<br>
            That Jesus Christ the savior, will put you under his wing<br>
            <br>
            [Choras]<br>
            If only my anguish and misery could be weighed<br>
            It would surely outweigh the sum of sand in the sea<br>
            When i'm trying to sleep, my dreams come up with waves<br>
            Of night terros i'm scared, so I toss and I turn<br>
            'Til it's dawn I stare while God snatches away<br>
            From my hands i'm mad I can't fight for myself<br>
            When i'm trying to sleep, my dreams come up with waves<br>
            Of night terros i'm scared, so I toss and I turn<br>
            <br>
            
            [Verse 2]<br>
            Serious illness ey mom? really why tell me now?<br>
            "He will drown in his tears" I figured you would say that<br>
            Guess what, It is a blessing that Jesus's setting you free<br>
            From this sickness I'm praying l promise you gon' be healed<br> 
            Days passed without change, l wasn't patient with pain<br>
            And the doctors either so l decided to pressure the lord:<br>
            "To the one that created the foundations of this earth<br> 
            I've been knocking on your door and if you sleeping wake up"<br>
            This is the moment when was l losing my shit<br>
            Losing mom and there was nothing l could do at this phase<br>
            Prayed not to lose faith, was a wreck when situations<br> 
            Went from to better to worse, "life happens to all"<br>
            I beg to differ, I'm under God's protection<br> 
            While my mom's still sick, reason why I'm praying<br> 
            Life should be lenient but mother died regardless<br>
            Thinking what could be more tragic under God's protection<br> 
            <br>
            
            [Choras]<br>
            If only my anguish and misery could be weighed<br>
            It would surely outweigh the sum of sand in the sea<br>
            When i'm trying to sleep, my dreams come up with waves<br>
            Of night terros i'm scared, so I toss and I turn<br>
            'Til it's dawn I stare while God snatches away<br>
            From my hands i'm mad I can't fight for myself<br>
            When i'm trying to sleep, my dreams come up with waves<br>
            Of night terros i'm scared, so I toss and I turn<br>
            <br>
            
            
            [Verse 3]<br>
            I'm a sheep without a shepard, and l am walking<br>
            Surrounded by tons of predators, grit my teeth<br>
            And raise my spirit one of us will die, or sleep in hell<br>
            But who is brave enough to question jesus? say "l don't<br>
            Deserve this", and who would understand his perspective?<br>
            Miseries and pain will always stay a mystery<br> 
            Prayers fade when you fathom you not different at all<br>
            Everybody's troubles are fated and so we striving to linger<br>
            Whether you christian or not, people say<br>
            The darkest hour is near the dawn, nothing good<br>
            At all came out from my mother's death surely l have<br> 
            Fears that I may cease to be, before I've written<br> 
            My parables in my rhythmic book of rhymes and fill up<br>
            My pages with all thoughts like a garner, harvesting<br> 
            All my grain and fill it in the storeroom,<br> 
            If that day would come through, surely I'd die with pride and gratitude.<br>
            <br>
            [Choras]<br>
            If only my anguish and misery could be weighed<br>
            It would surely outweigh the sum of sand in the sea<br>
            When i'm trying to sleep, my dreams come up with waves<br>
            Of night terros i'm scared, so I toss and I turn<br>
            'Til it's dawn I stare while God snatches away<br>
            From my hands i'm mad I can't fight for myself<br>
            When i'm trying to sleep, my dreams come up with waves<br>
            Of night terros i'm scared, so I toss and I turn
