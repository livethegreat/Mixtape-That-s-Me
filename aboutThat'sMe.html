        <p id="written">In this final song, Live reveals the rules and conventions that most new
            South African artists can't escape. 
            As newbies, they are gullible and can easily be swayed on how to look,
            sound or even rap - if they want to succeed. <br><br>
        
            He adds “I was advised to use my mother tongue"(IsiXhosa),
            as a way to show that he values his culture and is proud of who he is.
            Apparently this is what people would relate to, and help him gain a wider audience across the country.<br><br>
            
            To Live, this advice makes sense because the internet has made the world a smaller place;
            and if he rapped in English, he would have a lot more competition. 
            Live also observed that if a new South African hip hop artist raps in English,
            they are often accused of imitating American rappers. 
            <br>
            <br>
            However, later on in the song, Live questions these tricks for how a hip hop
            artist can succeed in South Africa. He reckons that no one really knows what will work,
            until audiences receive it.
            Live also states that these expert opinions on how to succeed are merely
          "answers that are based on the style or character that is a reflection of those at the top",
           which will cause a lot of competition, since everyone will be following those leads.<br><br>
        
          In this song, Live also gives his opinion about hip hop culture,
         and how popularity has been prioritised in this game.
        He believes that we all risk losing ourselves trying to please everyone else,
        whereas, without diversity, hip hop will lose it's integrity.<br><br>
        
        We witness Live reconnecting with himself.
        He scoffs at the excessive need for money and fame, which he was desperate for at the start of this mixtape.
        Now he sees his music as a gift, a way for him to understand and express himself.
        He decides that he must remain authentic regardless of what this world demands of him. <br>
